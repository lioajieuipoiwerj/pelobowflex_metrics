# About
The Peloton web application does not display target metrics, like cadence and resistance. This bookmarklet uses the Peloton web application and API to display the target metrics. Works in cycling classes viwed in the browser only.

# Metrics
- Two resistance ranges are displayed. The first is for the Keiser bike, the second is for Peloton (in parentheses). Resistance conversion is based on [this commonly accepted conversion chart](https://www.sippingandshopping.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Peloton-Keiser-Resistance-Conversion-Chart.jpg).
- Live and recently added classes do not have metrics. It can take a day or more for Peloton to add metrics to a recording.
- Metrics begin after the 1 minute warm-up.

# How to use
1. Start a cycling class on the Peloton website.
2. Open the PeloKeiser bookmark.
3. Metrics are magically displayed! (after the one minute start/warm-up)

Super special thanks to creator ZV3zrmCT who was generous enough to share their code after originally writing this project up with [Target Metrics and Schwinn IC4 Peloton resistance conversions](https://zv3zrmct.github.io/peloton_schwinn_metrics/).
